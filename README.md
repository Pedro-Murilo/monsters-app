## 🗒 About
I built this application in this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) from Udemy.
And this application was made with ReactJS! I've learned a lot content with this application, and the main thing was how ReactJS works, and why React was created. I've learned also how to works with components, and for this project it's so easy to understand!
